# Hotel-Cleaning-Time-Calculator
This is a project from the university that I created. It is made on both C++ and Python, and the point is to work in the file that contains vectors that resemble single-room and multiple-room apartments. There is a menu, it allows to change the hotel and is responsible for the UX.
